Place these images in `/public/images/`:

## Features

### ImageSlideshow Component
- **Navigation**: Arrow keys, click buttons, or space bar
- **Visual Effects**: Animated background, floating particles, smooth transitions
- **Progress Indicator**: Dots showing current position
- **Responsive Design**: Works on all screen sizes

### GameIntro Component
- **5 Image Slideshow**: Displays intro images 1-5
- **Start Button**: Beautiful gradient button to begin game
- **Feature Highlights**: Shows game features and benefits
- **Floating Elements**: Decorative animated elements

### GameOutro Component
- **Final Image**: Displays outro image 6

## Technical Implementation

### App.js Flow
```javascript
// Show intro for new users
if (showIntro) {
  return <GameIntro onStartGame={handleIntroComplete} />;
}

// Show outro when game is completed
if (showOutro) {
  return <GameOutro user={user} onRestart={handleOutroRestart} />;
}
```

### State Management
- `showIntro`: Controls intro slideshow display
- `showOutro`: Controls outro display
- `hasSeenIntro`: Tracks if user has seen intro (prevents showing again)

### Completion Detection
The outro is triggered when `user.gameProgress.completedClues.includes(8)` (step 8 completed).

## Customization

### Adding More Images
To add more intro images, update the `introImages` array in `GameIntro.jsx`:

```javascript
const introImages = [
  {
    src: "/images/intro-1.jpg",
    alt: "Happy Birthday Simran",
    title: "Happy Birthday, Simran!",
    description: "It's Your Special Day"
  },
  // Add more images here...
];
```

### Styling
- All components use Tailwind CSS
- Responsive design with mobile-first approach
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Gradient backgrounds and glassmorphism effects

### Image Requirements
- **Format**: JPG, PNG, or WebP
- **Size**: Recommended 1200x800px or similar aspect ratio
- **Optimization**: Compress images for web performance
- **Fallback**: Components handle missing images gracefully

## Testing

1. **Login Flow**: Test that intro shows after login
2. **Navigation**: Test arrow keys, buttons, and space bar
3. **Completion**: Test that outro shows when game is completed
4. **Responsive**: Test on different screen sizes
5. **Performance**: Ensure images load quickly

## Troubleshooting

### Images Not Loading
- Check file paths in `/public/images/`
- Verify image file names match exactly
- Check browser console for 404 errors

### Slideshow Not Starting
- Check that `hasSeenIntro` state is properly managed
- Verify user authentication is working
- Check console for JavaScript errors

### Outro Not Showing
- Verify step 8 completion detection
- Check `user.gameProgress.completedClues` array
- Ensure completion logic is working correctly

## Performance Tips

1. **Optimize Images**: Use tools like TinyPNG or ImageOptim
2. **Lazy Loading**: Images load as needed
3. **Caching**: Browser caches images for faster subsequent loads
4. **Fallbacks**: Graceful handling of missing images

## Future Enhancements

- **Video Support**: Add video slideshow capability
- **Audio**: Add background music or sound effects
- **Animations**: More complex animations and transitions
- **Personalization**: Dynamic content based on user data
